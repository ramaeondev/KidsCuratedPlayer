Name: YouKids
Summary: Safe video player for kids with parental control

Description: |-
    YouKids is a safe, parent-controlled video player designed to protect children 
    from algorithmic content addiction and inappropriate videos.
    
    Features:
    * Parent-curated content only
    * No algorithms or recommendations
    * No ads or tracking
    * Privacy-first design (COPPA/GDPR compliant)
    * Offline capable with device gallery videos
    * Automatic video categorization
    * Clean YouTube-style interface
    * No accounts required
    
    YouKids puts parents back in control of what their children watch. Instead of 
    YouTube's algorithm deciding content, you curate a safe collection of videos 
    from your device gallery.
