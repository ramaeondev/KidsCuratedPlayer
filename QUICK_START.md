## 📝 How Videos Are Organized

The app **automatically scans your entire gallery** and categorizes by resolution:

| Your Video | Resolution | Where It Shows |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Family vacation.mp4 | 1920x1080 (landscape) | Home tab |
| Kid dancing.mp4 | 1080x1920 (portrait) | Shorts tab |
| Birthday party.mp4 | 1280x720 (landscape) | Home tab |
| Funny moment.mp4 | 1080x1920 (portrait) | Shorts tab |

### 🎯 **100% Automatic**

- **Portrait/Vertical** (phone held upright) → Shorts tab
- **Landscape/Horizontal** (phone held sideways) → Home tab

No folders. No renaming. Just works!

## 💡 Optional: Better Organization

Want custom titles and channel names? Rename your videos like this:

**Format:** `Title - Channel Name.mp4`

**Examples:**
```
Birthday Party - Family Videos.mp4
Dance Performance - Kids Channel.mp4
Funny Moment - Home Videos.mp4
```

But it's **totally optional** - simple names work great too!

## 📊 Example: What You'll See

If your gallery has these videos:
```
Camera/
├── VID_20231015.mp4 (1920x1080) → Home tab
├── VID_20231016.mp4 (1080x1920) → Shorts tab

Downloads/
├── FunnyVideo.mp4 (1280x720) → Home tab
├── TikTokVideo.mp4 (1080x1920) → Shorts tab

WhatsApp/
├── Birthday.mp4 (1920x1080) → Home tab
└── Dance.mp4 (1080x1920) → Shorts tab
```

The app shows:
- **Home tab**: 3 landscape videos
- **Shorts tab**: 3 portrait videos

**All automatic - no manual setup!**
