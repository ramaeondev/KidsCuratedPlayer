# GitHub Actions Secrets Configuration

## üîê Required Secrets

Good news! **NO SECRETS REQUIRED** to get started! üéâ

### Automatic Secrets (Already Available)

#### `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- **What it is**: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- **Used for**: Creating releases, uploading artifacts
- **Setup required**: ‚ùå **NONE** - GitHub creates this automatically
- **Permissions**: Automatically granted to workflows
- **Location in workflows**: 
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml` (line 122)

**You don't need to add this secret!** GitHub provides it automatically when workflows run.

---

## üéØ Current Workflow Status

### ‚úÖ Build APK Workflow (`build-apk.yml`)
- **Secrets needed**: NONE
- **Ready to use**: YES
- **What it does**:
  - Builds APK automatically
  - Uploads as artifact
  - No authentication needed

### ‚úÖ Release Workflow (`release.yml`)
- **Secrets needed**: NONE (uses automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- **Ready to use**: YES
- **What it does**:
  - Creates GitHub releases
  - Attaches APK files
  - Uses GitHub's automatic token

## üöÄ Optional Secrets (For Advanced Features)

If you want to add more features in the future, here are optional secrets:

### 1. **Android Signing Key** (For Production Releases)
Currently not needed - workflows build debug APKs which work fine for personal use.

**If you want signed release APKs later:**

```bash
# Generate keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias my-key-alias
```

Then add these secrets to GitHub:
- `KEYSTORE_FILE` - Base64 encoded keystore file
- `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` - Keystore password
- `KEY_ALIAS` - Key alias name
- `KEY_PASSWORD` - Key password

**How to add:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/thavaneesh-dev/KidsCuratedPlayer/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add each secret

### 2. **Telegram Bot** (For Build Notifications)
If you want Telegram notifications when builds complete:

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Bot token from @BotFather
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` - Your chat ID

### 3. **Google Play Console** (For Auto-Upload to Play Store)
If you want to publish to Play Store automatically:

- `PLAY_STORE_JSON_KEY` - Service account JSON key
- `PLAY_STORE_TRACK` - Release track (internal/alpha/beta/production)

## ‚ú® What Works Right Now (No Setup Needed)

### Current Features:
‚úÖ **Automatic APK builds** on every push
‚úÖ **Artifact uploads** for download
‚úÖ **GitHub Releases** with APK attachments
‚úÖ **Version tagging** and release notes
‚úÖ **Direct download links** for sharing
‚úÖ **Build summaries** with APK info

### What You Can Do Immediately:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Workflows run automatically
3. Download APK from Actions or Releases
4. Share download links with anyone

## üîç Verify Permissions

After pushing workflows to GitHub, verify permissions are correct:

### Check Workflow Permissions:
1. Go to: https://github.com/thavaneesh-dev/KidsCuratedPlayer/settings/actions
2. Scroll to "Workflow permissions"
3. Ensure **"Read and write permissions"** is selected
4. Check ‚úÖ "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

**Default settings work fine!** GitHub automatically gives workflows permission to:
- ‚úÖ Create releases
- ‚úÖ Upload artifacts
- ‚úÖ Write to repository

---

## üìã Quick Start Checklist

Before running workflows:

- [ ] Push code to GitHub
- [ ] Check workflow permissions (usually correct by default)
- [ ] That's it! No secrets to configure! üéâ

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### What NOT to commit:
- ‚ùå `local.properties` (has SDK path)
- ‚ùå Keystore files (`.jks`, `.keystore`)
- ‚ùå API keys or passwords
- ‚ùå Personal tokens

### Already Protected:
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
- ‚úÖ Workflows use environment variables
- ‚úÖ `GITHUB_TOKEN` is ephemeral (expires after workflow)
- ‚úÖ Artifacts are encrypted at rest

---

## üß™ Testing Workflows

### Test Build Workflow:
```bash
# Push any change
git commit --allow-empty -m "Test workflow"
git push origin main

# Check: https://github.com/thavaneesh-dev/KidsCuratedPlayer/actions
```

### Test Release Workflow:
```bash
# Create a test tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Test release"
git push origin v0.1.0

# Check: https://github.com/thavaneesh-dev/KidsCuratedPlayer/releases
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "GITHUB_TOKEN permissions are insufficient"

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/thavaneesh-dev/KidsCuratedPlayer/settings/actions
2. Under "Workflow permissions"
3. Select "Read and write permissions"
4. Save

### Issue: "Unable to create release"

**Solution:**
- Check repository visibility (public or private - both work)
- Verify workflow permissions are "Read and write"
- Ensure tag follows format: `v1.0.0` (starts with 'v')

### Issue: "Artifact upload failed"

**Solution:**
- Check APK size (must be under 2GB)
- Verify build succeeded before upload
- Check workflow logs for specific error

## üéì Advanced: Adding Secrets (If Needed Later)

### How to Add Secrets:

1. **Navigate to repository settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/thavaneesh-dev/KidsCuratedPlayer/settings/secrets/actions
   ```

2. **Click "New repository secret"**

3. **Add secret:**
   - Name: `SECRET_NAME` (uppercase with underscores)
   - Value: Your secret value
   - Click "Add secret"

4. **Use in workflow:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Use secret
     env:
       MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}
     run: |
       echo "Secret is available in workflow"
   ```

### Example: Adding Signing Key

```yaml
# In workflow file
- name: Sign APK
  env:
    KEYSTORE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.KEYSTORE_PASSWORD }}
    KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.KEY_PASSWORD }}
  run: |
    ./gradlew assembleRelease \
      -Pandroid.injected.signing.store.password=$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \
      -Pandroid.injected.signing.key.password=$KEY_PASSWORD
```

## üìù Summary

### Current Setup:
- ‚úÖ **Zero secrets required**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic GitHub token**
- ‚úÖ **Ready to use immediately**
- ‚úÖ **Secure by default**

### Next Steps:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Workflows run automatically
3. Download APKs from Actions/Releases
4. No configuration needed!

### Future Enhancements (Optional):
- Add signing keys for production releases
- Set up Play Store deployment
- Configure notifications
- All optional - works great without them!
